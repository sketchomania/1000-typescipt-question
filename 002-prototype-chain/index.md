## What is a prototype chain

    Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language.

    The prototype on object instance is available through Object.getPrototypeOf(object) or **proto** property whereas prototype on constructors function is available through Object.prototype.
